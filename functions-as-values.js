var foo = function() {
	// ..
}

var x = function bar(){
	// ..
};

/*

The first function expression assigned to the foo variable is called anonymous because it has no name.

The second function expression is named (bar), even as a reference to it is also assigned to the x variable. Named function expressions are generally more 
preferable, though anonymous function expressions are still extremely common.
